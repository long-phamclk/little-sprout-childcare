The application allow user to log the daily checklist as they have done the tasks, and for user to save a note for the center manager later. The history of logs is saved in local storage and will be served in the history page as well as the notes will be served in the note page.
This project use Vite, React, ReactDom, Radix-UI and Styled Component. This is purely a front end application follow my interest as an ex Kinder Teacher to simplify my colleague's daily tasks.
In the future, there should be login/signup features for users and all the database should use an appropriate database such as Mongodb or SQL.
